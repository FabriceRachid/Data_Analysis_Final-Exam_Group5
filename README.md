Introduction

This project analyzes a health dataset to identify key risk factors associated with diabetes. Using Python and standard data analysis techniques, the study examines health indicators, lifestyle behaviors, medical history, and demographic characteristics in order to uncover meaningful patterns related to diabetes risk. The project is conducted for academic purposes and illustrates practical skills in data preprocessing, analysis, and interpretation.

I. Problem Statement

Diabetes is a major public health concern influenced by multiple factors. This project aims to identify and analyze factors associated with diabetes prevalence by exploring structured data related to health conditions, lifestyle habits, medical background, and demographic variables. The objective is to highlight patterns that may contribute to diabetes risk within a population.

II. Object-Oriented Design

The project is structured to ensure clarity, consistency, and reusability. The target variable is binary and represents diabetes status, where 0 indicates no diabetes and 1 indicates the presence of diabetes. The features used in the analysis are grouped into health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose level, lifestyle factors including physical activity, smoking habits, and diet, medical history variables such as previous conditions and family history, and demographic information including age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Categorical variables are encoded into binary values to ensure compatibility with statistical analysis and modeling techniques. Raw data is cleaned and preprocessed before being passed to the analysis and visualization components.

III. How to Run the Project

The project can be executed in two ways. In interactive mode, the Jupyter Notebook allows users to run the analysis step by step and directly visualize the results. In non-interactive mode, the main Python script can be executed from the command line, which is suitable for automated execution. Before running the project, Python must be installed and all required libraries should be installed using the provided requirements file. The environment setup should then be verified to ensure proper execution.

IV. Assumptions and Design Decisions

Several assumptions and methodological decisions guide this project. Missing values are handled using appropriate statistical techniques, and outliers are treated based on their impact on the analysis results. Feature engineering focuses on selecting variables that are relevant to diabetes risk and applying transformations to improve interpretability. The analysis strategy combines exploratory data analysis with descriptive statistics, and visualizations are used to clearly illustrate relationships between variables. It is assumed that the dataset is representative of the studied population, that correlation does not imply causation, and that the data quality is sufficient for academic analysis.

V. Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is a real-world health dataset containing medical, lifestyle, and demographic variables. It provides summary statistics of key features and shows the distribution of the diabetes target variable, offering a general understanding of the data before detailed analysis.

VI. Analysis Structure Breakdown

The analysis follows a logical workflow that begins with data loading and preprocessing, followed by exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. Visualization and interpretation are then performed to extract insights, and the process concludes with a summary of the main findings.

VII. Key Findings Summary

The analysis identifies major health-related factors associated with diabetes, particularly indicators linked to physical condition and medical history. Lifestyle behaviors also show a significant association with diabetes prevalence. Additionally, age and socioeconomic factors appear to influence diabetes risk within the dataset.

VIII. Project Structure

The project is organized into clearly structured folders that separate raw data, processed data, notebooks, scripts, and outputs. This organization improves readability, maintainability, and ease of navigation.

IX. User Notes and Requirements

A basic understanding of Python and data analysis concepts is recommended to fully benefit from this project. The project is intended strictly for academic and educational purposes, and the results should not be interpreted as medical advice.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analysis techniques can be applied to better understand factors associated with diabetes. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and visualization, meaningful patterns related to health, lifestyle, and demographic variables were identified. Although the findings provide valuable insights, they are limited to the scope and quality of the available dataset and do not imply causation. Overall, the project highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in health-related studies and serves as a practical academic exercise in applied data analytics.
